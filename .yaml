  This project simulates a multi-player monopoly game play in the terminal. 
  At the start of the game, a player can define how many players are playing the game. 
  Then, players take turns taking actions like rolling dice, moving their character around the board, 
  paying rent, buying properties, trading properties, buying houses and hotels, paying taxes, 
  and winning the free parking lottery. Players are kicked out of the game if they go bankrupt 
  (and their properties and assets to the player that bankrupted them) and the game ends
   when there is only one player left. The monopoly board representation is printed into the terminal 
   with every action.
